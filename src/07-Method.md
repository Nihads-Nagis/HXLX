# 07 — METHOD

## Governance, Control & Evolution Layer

---

## Status

* [x] Auditability
* [x] Defensibility
* [x] ISO Compliant
* [x] Anti-capture economics
* [x] Evolution under attack
* [x] Civilization-safe scaling

---

## Purpose

METHOD is the **control plane** of the system. It governs **why**, **when**, **how fast**, **by whom**, and **under what ethical, economic, and civilizational constraints** the system evolves.

METHOD binds and regulates:

* **MICRO-HXs** — foundational primitives and constraints
* **MINI-LXs** — executable products and applications
* **MACRO** — economic, social, and planetary feedback loops
* **MATTER** — valuation, energy, and real-world impact

METHOD does not optimize for speed, profit, or dominance. It optimizes for **continuity, resilience, and non-capture evolution**.

---

## Micro Strategies

Micro strategies define *internal operational control*. They regulate execution modes, escalation paths, deterrence mechanisms, and contribution economics.

### 1. Quad Strategy Modes

METHOD operates on a **complete trinary control logic** expressed through three quads:

* **9999** — Open Evolution Mode
* **0000** — Strategic Deterrence Mode
* **1111** — Civilizational Gating Mode

Together, these form a closed, non-gameable control surface.

#### Quad 9999 — Open Evolution

Default mode of operation.

Characteristics:

* Public execution
* Defensive reset capability
* Evolutionary unlocks
* Open Hand Protocol

Scope:

* Applies to **Hx00 → Hx34**, excluding explicitly **LOCKED hexes**

Purpose:

* Maximize transparency
* Accelerate learning
* Encourage forks, inspection, and reuse

---

#### Quad 0000 — Strategic Deterrence

This mode is **literal**, not symbolic.

Characteristics:

* Hard deterrence mechanism
* Selective systemic reset

Mechanism:

* Activation applies **LOCKED hexes**:

  * Hx15
  * Hx16
  * Hx17
  * Hx23

Purpose:

* Prevent capture
* Halt misuse
* Enforce irreversible constraints under adversarial pressure

---

#### Quad 1111 — Civilizational Gating

Future-unlock mode.

Characteristics:

* Gated by *civilizational readiness*, not timelines or revenue
* Non-accelerable by capital or authority

Scope:

* Applies to **Hx34 → Hx40**

Purpose:

* Prevent premature deployment of irreversible capabilities
* Align technological power with collective maturity

---

### 2. Cybernetic Governance System

METHOD replaces traditional management structures with a **cybernetic governance loop**, aligned with **ISO 9001** and **ISO 27001** principles.
###

### 3. ZERO

#### 1. Zero R&D

No speculative research pipeline.

* The system does not compete in quantum, base-4, or supremacy races
* Operates on **RGB+A / base-256 semantics**
* Focused on *logical recomposition*, not raw invention

The strategy is not to sprint forward, but to **sprint backward through existing artifacts**, recombining what already exists.

---

#### 2. Zero Cost

The system is designed to be **self-sustaining from its first viable milestone**.

Principles:

* No fixed burn
* No capital dependency
* No financial liabilities

Initial infrastructure assumptions:

* Commodity notebooks (e.g. Colab-class environments)
* Parameterized CPU and GPU execution
* Minimal orchestration (local / remote CPU-GPU pipelines)
* Stateless synchronization (e.g. object storage replication)

Scaling is allowed **only when it pays for itself**.

---

#### 3. Zero Hiring — Fork & Support Only

Human participation is not recruited; it is **discovered and supported**.

Principles:

* No traditional HR
* No payroll expansion
* No centralized labor dependency

Mechanism:

* Every hex maps to existing repositories, libraries, or prior work
* Value is returned to creators through targeted support

A **Talent Resource Manager (TRM)** replaces HR:

* Observes contribution signals
* Infers needs across Maslow-like gradients
* Issues support actions (from attention → tools → capital)
* Operates via transparent issue-based communication

---
<!--Merge this Zero hiring with repo investing-->
#### Repo Investing

Investment is not made in people, companies, or training.

Investment is made in:

* **Repositories representing peak collective human effort**
* Forks that align with METHOD constraints
* Cherry-picked resolutions and issue closures

Capital is expressed as:

* Attention
* Maintenance
* Security hardening
* Sustained relevance

---

#### Security

Security is treated as **dual-use awareness**, not perimeter defense.

Principles:

* Every successful unit is assumed to be exploitable
* Each boundary crossed informs the next constraint
* Unit tests feed forward into system-level deterrence

The shortest path to misuse validation is prioritized, ensuring:

* Early discovery of failure modes
* Controlled escalation
* Memory of how each capability was unlocked

---

## Macro Strategies

Macro strategies define **external interaction surfaces** — how METHOD interfaces with time, attention, markets, ecosystems, and civilization itself.

### 1. Tokenization of Time

Time is the primary scarce resource.

* Time is measured, not monetized
* Contribution is evaluated by temporal commitment and impact
* Speculation on future time is disallowed

---

### 2. Earth Ether Exchange (E³ / W³)

A tri-win exchange layer:

* Individual
* Collective
* Planetary

Attention, intent, and effort form the exchange medium — not currency.

---

### 3. EarthLab

A planetary-scale experimentation layer.

* No labs, only probes
* No pilots, only live feedback
* Every deployment is a measurement

---

### 4. EarthGit

Reality version control.

* Events are commits
* Crises are diffs
* Recovery is merge conflict resolution

PEST vectorization converts:

* Market ticks
* Environmental events
* Social shifts

into **versioned state**.

---

### 5. Return on Carats (RoC)

Humans possess **24 Carats** of potential, aligned with Gardner-style multiple intelligences.

METHOD’s mission:

* Identify latent Carats
* Remove friction
* Amplify output

Return is measured as **empowerment per human**, not productivity per dollar.

---
### 6. Problems Gamification


## Closing Constraint

METHOD exists to ensure that **no layer outruns its ethical, civilizational, or ecological envelope**.

If MICRO defines *what is possible*, METHOD defines *what is permissible*.
