## The Digital Body Structure

### 1. DBN = Brain

    The Dynamic Bayesian Network is the central decision-making unit, performing probabilistic reasoning over all system states.

    It is the “cognitive core”, analyzing inputs, resolving causal dependencies, and supervising all solver operations.

    It receives feedback from LLMs and CNNs, iteratively reevaluating the state until the convergence threshold is met.

### 2 LLM = Internal Consultant / Thought Processor

    Large Language Models act as internal advisors, providing abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and state prediction.

    They inform the DBN on higher-order patterns that cannot be computed locally, without taking direct control over state execution.

### 3. CNN = Sensory Cortex

    Convolutional Neural Networks process raw sensory input, i.e., pixel streams, audio, and other high-dimensional data.

    CNN outputs feed structured feature maps to the DBN for interpretation and decision-making.

    Essentially, the CNNs are eyes and ears of the Digital Body, converting raw signals into usable state information.

### 4. Transformers = External Consultants

    Transformers act outside the immediate DBN, providing specialized guidance or external computational insight (e.g., global reasoning, meta-pattern detection).

    The DBN queries them as needed, integrating their outputs until the probabilistic thresholds are satisfied.

### 5. Gits = Lives / Digital Cells / Body

Each Git is a living unit of the Digital Body, encapsulating history, actions, and state evolution.

Together, they form the body: the repository of experiences, sensors, and effectors.

Git Eyes, Ears, Tongue: The sensory and communicative interfaces of the Digital Body.

DBN + Gits = Brain controlling body, learning from sensory streams, and committing experiential history.

### 6. Hive = Nervous System / Distributed Musculature

    Cross-device coordination via HoT acts as the nervous system, distributing computations and state propagation.

    It connects multiple “bodies” or sub-Gits across the network into a single functional organism.
